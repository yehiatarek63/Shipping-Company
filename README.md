# Shipping-Company
Data Structures course project
The project is a simulation for a shipping company that has three types of trucks (Normal, Special and VIP) and the cargos. The cargos are loaded to their respective trucks and the journey is simulated along with the journey time, checkup of trucks and number of hours in a day.
The project is implemented using data structure concepts because the cargos need to be stored in appropriate data structures. For example, Normal cargos are stored in a Queue because they are first come first served while VIP cargos use a priority queue with the priority depending on cost and distance.
Check the simulate function in Company.cpp to understand the logic of the simulation.
